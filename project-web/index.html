                Mount Everest is located on the border between Nepal and Tibet (a region of China). The southern slopes
                are in Nepal, while the northern slopes are in Tibet. The mountain is part of the Mahalangur Himal
                sub-range in the Himalayas. Like other high peaks in the region, Mount Everest has long been revered by
                local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World” or
                “Goddess of the Valley.”
